# superflycss

![Superfly](superfly.jpeg)

Modularized, [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability#System_Design), and responsive CSS variables, components, utilities, typography, their foundation, and corresponding structural, build, and test methodology designed to be forward compatible with [custom elements / web components](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/customelements).

This is the uber repository providing an overview and description of the the facets of the superflycss project.  All components and utilities reside in their own repository.  To see all repositories related to this project [click here](https://github.com/superflycss).

### Builds

- [Build Speed](https://medium.com/@ole.ersoy/speeding-up-superflycss-builds-2eb284bd300b)

### Design Rationale

- [Merging of Variable Repositories](https://medium.com/@ole.ersoy/superflycss-merging-of-variable-repositories-54cd2b88dff2)
- [Container vs. Item](https://medium.com/@ole.ersoy/container-vs-item-423586b1b21e)

## Objectives

The aim of [superflycss](https://github.com/superflycss/superflycss) is to maximize designer and developer productivity, cross eco system utilization, and to minimize maintenance effort by providing:
- [SuperflyCSS Component and Utility Naming Conventions](https://github.com/superflycss/superflycss/blob/master/naming-conventions.md) that provide predictability, clarity, transparency, simplicity, and consistency to the CSS markup and the corresponding end result.  
- A la carte flexibility.  Use only the parts that you want to use.
- A robust CSS foundation / base
- Small focused CSS modules that can be installed with a package manager (NPM), are easily customizable, live in their own repository, are updated and [semver versioned](https://semver.org/) independently of other components or utilities, adhere to a [Module philosophy](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#module-philosophy), and are free of [side effects](https://philipwalton.com/articles/side-effects-in-css/) and [naming collisions](https://philipwalton.com/articles/side-effects-in-css/).  Small modules are less intimidating for new users to get started with and allow developers to find and review code as quickly as possible.
- Dependency management for CSS modules and build tools
- Test cases clearly illustrating how to utilize the css module features and how to get about customization
- The ability to incorporate future CSS specification features, such as variables, now using [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss).
- Naming and structural conventions for CSS elements, components, utilities, and repositories
- End to end [superflycss/cli](https://github.com/superflycss/cli) live reload build examples
- Well documented and tested code that incorporates design rationale
- A standardized [project layout](https://github.com/superflycss/pli) for all project repositories
- Project initiation and live reload building and workflow automation provided by [superflycss/cli](https://github.com/superflycss/cli) 
- Adherence to [semver guidelines](http://semver.org/) for update releases
- RxJS style module imports for all css sub modules
- Asset grouping.  Since each component, utility, or tool has its own repository, any javascript, image, or other resource that is used for functional or demo purposes is easy to find. 
- Filtered communication and updates.  If you are only interested in watching for changes to the [Header Component](https://github.com/superflycss/component-header), click the github watch button for that repository only.

The framework will also help you become a better programmer 
as the design of and utilization of components and utilities 
mirrors how object oriented and functional programmers think.

## Installation

### SuperflyCSS CLI (Command Line Interface)

```console
npm i -g @superflycss/cli
```
### SuperflyCSS Variables, Components, and Utilities

**SuperflyCSS** css modules can be installed via NPM.  For example install the color module by running:

```console
npm i @superflycss/variables-colors
```  
## Usage 

### New Project Creation

Create a project name `component-super`:

```console
sfc new -t c  component-super
```  

### CLI Live Reload

To build, serve, and live reload the `component-super` project run:

```console
cd component-super
sfc s component-super
```
[Browser-Sync](https://browsersync.io/) is now serving the 'serve' directory.  The directories `src/main/css`, `src/test/css`, and `src/test/html` are watched, file changes are compiled to `serve` and the browser is refreshed automatically.  Happy live reloading!

### Creating a Composite Build from CSS Modules

Import the module using `@import <module_name>`.  For example:
```css
@import '@superflycss/variables-colors';
```

Then customize by overriding CSS variables and/or extending the CSS.  Once your CSS file is complete, build it using the CLI by running:

```console
sfc build:main:css
```  

Or use the abbreviated version:

```console
sfc bmc
```

### Prepublishing Variables, Components, or Utilities

```console
sfc dist
```  

Or use the abbreviated version:
```console
sfc d
```


### Foundation

All superflycss rendering assumes the utilization of the [superflycss/foundation](https://github.com/superflycss/foundation) module in order to keep code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself).  Thus in order to guarantee consistent results always include the [superflycss/foundation](https://github.com/superflycss/foundation) module import first.
